<p>Change your transmission fluid regularly. The level and condition of the fluid is often overlooked but is vital for your transmissions performance and endurance. Transmission fluid cools and lubricates the transmission. Healthy fluid is transparent and red. If your fluid is very dark and/or smells burnt you should seek assistance before further damage occurs.</p>

<p>Check to ensure your transmission fluid is not low or dirty</p>

<p>There are different types of transmission fluid; ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) and manual transmissions require regular motor oil, hyphoid gear oil or regular ATF fluid.</p>

<p>Check your owners manual</p>

<p>Check your parking stall for leaks as this early warning sign can save you money down the road. Internal transmission parts may be wearing down and if left unchecked can lead to major repair instead of maintenance.</p>

<p>Be aware that overheating damages a transmission. Metal shavings can come off of the gears and contaminate the fluid. This will result in a gradual breakdown of the transmission if the bits of metal are not removed.</p>

<p>This is why timely maintenance your transmission is so important</p>

<p>If you do a lot of towing or make lengthy trips your transmission fluid can deteriorate more rapidly.</p>

<p>Although each manufacturer has specific recommendations for transmission servicing the average miles are between:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Manual Transmission: 25,000 ? 55,000 Miles</li>
	<li>Automatic Transmission: 75,000 ? 100,000 Miles</li>
</ul>

<p><em>* It is still important to check fluid levels and condition regularly*</em></p>
